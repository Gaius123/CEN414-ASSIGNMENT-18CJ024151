Every year in Africa, at least 125,000 women and 870,000 newborns die in the
first week after birth, yet this is when coverage and programmes are at their
lowest along the continuum of care. The first day is the time of highest risk
for both mother and baby. The fact that 18 million women in Africa currently
do not give birth in a health facility poses challenges for planning and
implementing postnatal care (PNC) for women and their newborns.
Regardless of place of birth, mothers and newborns spend most of the
postnatal period (the first six weeks after birth) at home.
Postnatal care (PNC) programmes are among the weakest of all
reproductive and child health programmes in the region. How can we
increase the coverage of integrated maternal and newborn care in the
postnatal period?
